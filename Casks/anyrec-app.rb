  caveats <<~EOS
    AnyRec lives in the menu bar — it has no Dock icon and no window.

    Open it once and it will ask for Screen Recording; grant that and Microphone
    under System Settings > Privacy & Security, then quit and reopen it. The
    grant only applies to newly launched processes.

    Recordings land in ~/Desktop/AnyRec Recordings. ffmpeg is what merges the
    three tracks into a playable call.mp4; without it you still get the tracks,
    but screen.mov has no audio of its own:

      brew install ffmpeg

    Settings > Transcription installs whisper and its models, or takes an OpenAI
    key. The terminal tool is a separate install, not a prerequisite:

      brew install doruchiulan/tap/anyrec
